# Remote Patient Monitoring & Telemedicine Usability Study

## Abstract
A usability and data analysis case study evaluating telemedicine solutions for heart failure patients.

## Problem Statement
Heart Failure (HF) presents a growing burden with high readmission rates. This project explored how remote patient monitoring (RPM) tools improve care and reduce hospitalizations.

## Objectives
- Evaluate the effectiveness of RPM and telehealth systems.
- Identify usability barriers and gather qualitative feedback.
- Provide design and workflow recommendations.

## My Role
- Conducted usability tests with 22 student pharmacists and patients.
- Analyzed data from 64 patients tied to Lima Memorial HF Clinic.
- Created user personas, workflows, and usability charts.
- Built visual diagrams and prototypes to map behavior and interactions.

## Tools & Technologies
Citrix Gateway, ECW Live, Meditech EHR, Usability Testing, Affinity Diagrams, Personas, Prototypes, Figma, Canva
