## 🧪 Prototype Testing

We developed and tested a prototype system that let patients:
- Book appointments
- Submit self-reported HF symptoms
- Receive feedback remotely

💬 Collected user feedback to enhance usability, security, and accessibility.

## 📘 Learnings

- Conducted contextual interviews & user observations in a clinical environment
- Analyzed behavioral data and feedback to derive UX insights
- Mapped user personas and designed healthcare-specific workflows
