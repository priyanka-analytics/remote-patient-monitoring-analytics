# Remote Patient Monitoring & Telemedicine Usability Study

A real-world study evaluating the usability and impact of telemedicine on heart failure patients using Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) tools.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Heart Failure (HF) is a critical healthcare concern. This project explores how RPM and telemedicine can help reduce hospital readmissions and improve patient outcomes.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate the usability and effectiveness of remote monitoring tools.
- Track the impact of educational interventions on hospital admissions.
- Identify usability barriers and provide design recommendations.

## 👩‍⚕️ My Role
- Conducted contextual inquiries with 22 student pharmacists.
- Analyzed feedback from 64 HF patients.
- Created personas, storyboards, and usability test visualizations.
- Designed and tested a mobile prototype for remote interactions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Citrix Gateway · ECW Live · Meditech EHR · Figma · PowerPoint · Usability Testing · Affinity Diagrams

## 📊 Key Results
- 25% drop in hospital readmissions (within 90–120 days).
- Enhanced medication adherence and appointment compliance.
- Uncovered key usability issues and made actionable recommendations.

## 🧪 Prototype & Testing
Visuals for the patient and doctor interfaces, along with charts showing user feedback and performance.

## 📁 Folder Structure
