# Remote Patient Monitoring & Telemedicine Usability Study

**Empowering Heart Health Through Data-Driven Telemedicine**  
A real-world study on remote monitoring of heart failure patients

---

## 🧭 Abstract / Overview

This project evaluates the real-world impact of remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems in heart failure (HF) care. Using qualitative methods such as interviews, usability testing, and data observation, we assessed how a telemedicine prototype improved patient outcomes and reduced hospital readmissions.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Heart failure is a growing healthcare concern due to frequent hospitalizations and high readmission rates. Our challenge was to explore how digital interventions — specifically, RPM tools — can support patients and clinicians in managing HF care remotely.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Assess the usability and effectiveness of an RPM system.
- Evaluate educational interventions and data outcomes.
- Identify system pain points, barriers, and recommendations.

---

## 👩‍⚕️ My Role

- Conducted usability testing and contextual interviews with 22 student pharmacists.
- Observed and analyzed behaviors from 64 heart failure patients in Lima Memorial HF Clinic.
- Created personas, flowcharts, affinity diagrams, and visual insights.
- Prototyped UI screens to simulate a telemedicine dashboard.

## 📈 Key Results

- **25%** reduction in hospital readmissions (90–120 day period)
- Increased medication adherence and appointment compliance
- Identified usability blockers (internet access, password reset complexity)

---

## 🚧 Design Challenges & Fixes

- Login issues → Suggested two-factor authentication + biometric access
- Scheduling inefficiencies → Added calendar selector to prototype
- Non-intuitive dashboard → Created walkthrough onboarding screens

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Develop a mobile app version to increase accessibility.
- Automate patient alerts with customizable thresholds.
- Embed educational video content inside the RPM tool.

---

## 🧠 Final Reflections

This project gave me deep insights into how real-world telehealth applications work — from EHR systems to user psychology. I enhanced my ability to conduct usability research, tell compelling data stories, and visualize results for clinical outcomes.
